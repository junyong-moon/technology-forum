I implemented tailwind CSS for a research topic. It is implemented in each hbs file.

For the representativeness of the layout file, please refer to the [layout.hbs](views/layout.hbs) file.

The Tailwind CSS classes in elements present in the hbs files are complied to [output.css](src/output.css) file.
